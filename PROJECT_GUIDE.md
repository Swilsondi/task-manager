# Project Guide & Best Practices

## What You Did Well

- Used semantic HTML and modern CSS for a clean, accessible UI.
- Leveraged JavaScript arrays and localStorage for persistent state.
- Modularized code with clear functions for rendering and logic.
- Used Font Awesome for intuitive, visually appealing action buttons.
- Documented your code and project structure.

## How to Enhance & Refactor

- **State Management:**  
  Store all task states (active, completed, deleted) in localStorage for full persistence.
- **Single Source of Truth:**  
  Consider using a single array of objects (with a `status` property) for all tasks, then filter for rendering.
- **Event Delegation:**  
  For large lists, attach one event listener to the parent and use event bubbling for better performance.
- **Accessibility:**  
  Add ARIA labels, roles, and keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
- **UI Feedback:**  
  Add toasts or notifications for actions (task added, deleted, recovered).
- **Testing:**  
  Write unit tests for your core logic functions.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Handle edge cases (empty input, duplicate tasks, etc.) gracefully.
- **Code Comments:**  
  Keep your code well-commented, but avoid over-commenting obvious lines.

## Tips for Future Projects

- **Plan your data model** before coding. Think about how you’ll store and update your data.
- **Break your UI into components** (even in vanilla JS) for easier updates and maintenance.
- **Keep logic and rendering separate** for clarity and reusability.
- **Use version control** (like Git) and commit often.
- **Write clear, concise documentation** for yourself and others.
- **Refactor regularly**—don’t be afraid to improve your code as you learn.
- **Ask for feedback** from others and review your own code critically.
